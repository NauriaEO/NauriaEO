## Hi, I'm Nauria Emanuely de Oliveira 👋
I'm a Computer Science & Business Administration student at Northeastern University. I like how the language of computers allows people to connect with others anywhere and hope to incorporate diverse ideas into my work through collaboration. I am interested in using my computer science knowledge to create products that can improve people’s lives, while applying business concepts to make people aware of them.
